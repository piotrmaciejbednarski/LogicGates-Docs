title: Translations
---

This section describes the plugin's translation system and how it supports internationalization. The plugin uses a YAML file **messages.yml** to store various messages that can be translated. The plugin has built-in **English**, which is the default language.

## Message Structure

The `messages.yml` file is organized by language codes (e.g., `en`, `pl`, `de`, `es`). Each language section contains key-value pairs, where the key identifies the message and the value is the translated text. Messages can include color codes (using the `&` character) for rich text formatting.

```yaml
messages:
  en:
    prefix: "&8[&6LogicGates&8] &r"
    errors:
      no_permission: "&cYou don't have permission!"
      # ... other error messages
    update_checker:
      checking: "&6Checking for updates..."
      # ... other update checker messages
    gui_title: "&0Choose gate type"
    # ... other messages
```

## Message Formatting

If a message for the specified language is not found, the plugin falls back to the English translation (`messages.en.*`). If even the English translation is missing, a "Missing translation" message is displayed.

The plugin retrieves the language-specific prefix (e.g., `&8[&6LogicGates&8] &r`) and prepends it to the translated message.

`ChatColor.translateAlternateColorCodes('&', ...)` translates color codes (e.g., `&c` to red, `&6` to gold) into the format recognized by the server.

## Internationalization

To add support for a new language, simply create a new section in the **messages.yml** file with the corresponding language code (e.g., `es` for Spanish) and translate all the messages. Make sure your version of **messages.yml** is up-to-date. You can download it from the latest release on the GitHub repository.

## File Initialization

Plugin ensures that the **messages.yml** file exists. If it doesn't, it copies the default **messages.yml** file from the plugin's resources.

## Changing the Language

If you have other translations, you can set them from the server using the command `/logicgates language <language code>`. You can also do this by editing the `language` key in the **config.yml** file and reloading the configuration with the `/logicgates reload` command.
