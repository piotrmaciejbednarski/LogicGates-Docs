## Why do I need to connect "expanders" to the output instead of connecting redstone directly?

The Bukkit/Spigot/PaperMC engines update redstone, comparators, and repeaters every tick. This means that if the plugin tries to override the state of an object, it will be reset in the next update. Using a repeater on a gate’s output can create a "clock" effect. However, redstone alone only works for one block, and extending the circuit causes the signal to be lost.

The solution is to use **safe output expanders**, such as **buttons, levers, or observers** — these retain their state and are not updated by the server every tick. This ensures stability and prevents bugs in your mechanisms.

## Does the plugin impact performance?

No, the plugin generally has no impact on performance. However, a very high number of logic gates may lead to performance issues.

To maintain performance, consider adjusting settings like **particle effects** in **config.yml**.

## I’m experiencing issues with the plugin, and it’s not my fault

Bugs can happen — the plugin is not completely stable. I actively work on improving the plugin and fixing bugs. You can also **report issues on GitHub** or suggest changes via the [Issues page](https://github.com/piotrmaciejbednarski/LogicGates/issues).
