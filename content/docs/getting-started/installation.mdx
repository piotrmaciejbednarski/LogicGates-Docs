title: Installing LogicGates
---

Download the latest version of the **LogicGates plugin** from the [official GitHub repository](https://github.com/piotrmaciejbednarski/LogicGates).

Place the downloaded .jar file (e.g., LogicGates-1.1.5.jar) in the **plugins** folder of your Bukkit/Spigot server. Start or restart the server. The LogicGates plugin will be loaded automatically.

## Requirements

- The LogicGates plugin is compatible with **versions 1.16** and later.
- It is recommended to use the latest stable version of **Spigot or Paper**.
- The plugin requires **Java version 17** or later.

The latest version has been compiled for PaperMC for maximum optimization.

The LogicGates plugin works with Multiverse-Core and WorldEdit plugins (optional). Their presence may extend the functionality of the plugin, but they are **not required** for it to function.
