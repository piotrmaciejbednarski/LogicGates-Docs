---

To properly manage permissions in the **Logic Gates** plugin, players must be granted the appropriate permissions.

- **logicgates.place**: Allows the player to create logic gates.

- **logicgates.break**: Allows the player to destroy existing logic gates.

- **logicgates.admin**: Permissions for administrators. Allows the use of commands such as `debug`, `update`, `save`, `redstonecompatibility`, `fixparticles`, `particles`, `language`, `reload`. These commands enable debugging, plugin updates, saving the state of logic gates, managing redstone compatibility, fixing particle effects, and other administrative functions.

- **logicgates.give**: Permission for players who can use the GUI to select logic gates with the `/logicgates menu` command. This provides easy access to various gates in the plugin.

- **logicgates.inspect**: Permission that allows players to activate the logic gate inspection mode. The `/logicgates inspect` command allows viewing the properties of gates in-game.

- **logicgates.rotate**: Permission granting players a special wand to rotate logic gates with the `/logicgates rotate` command.

- **logicgates.toggleinput**: Permission allowing players to change the number of inputs on a selected logic gate. Players can modify the number of inputs using the `/logicgates toggleinput` command.

- **logicgates.timer**: Permission enabling players to set the wait time for the TIMER gate using the `/logicgates timer` command.
