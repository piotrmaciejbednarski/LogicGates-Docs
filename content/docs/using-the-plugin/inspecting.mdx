title: Logic Gate Inspection
---

When the `/logicgates inspect` command is entered, and the player clicks on a gate block in inspection mode, it checks the input states and provides the player with information about the gate's output state, type, and direction.

The plugin also includes another command designed for active monitoring. This is the `/logicgates debug` command, which, when entered, enables the player's "debug mode." In this mode, within a 16-block radius, all changes in the output state of logic gates are sent as messages to the player. This mode provides much more detailed information, such as:

- Gate coordinates
- Gate type
- Gate direction
- States of all three inputs
- Output state

Entering `/logicgates debug` again disables debug mode.
