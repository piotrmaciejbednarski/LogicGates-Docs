title: Changing timer cooldown
---

In addition to standard logic gates, the plugin also includes custom gates such as the **TIMER gate** and **RS Latch**. The TIMER gate functions as an **oscillator**, periodically sending an output signal. Unlike other gates, it has no inputs—only a single output.

By default, the TIMER gate generates a signal every second. This interval can be adjusted using the command `/logicgates timer <seconds>`. After entering the command and clicking on a TIMER gate, its oscillation interval will be updated to the specified number of seconds.

If you need more precise timing (e.g., milliseconds instead of whole seconds), you can manually modify the cooldown value in the `gates.json` file. The timing values in this file are stored in milliseconds, allowing for finer control over the gate’s behavior.
