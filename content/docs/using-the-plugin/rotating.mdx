title: Rotating a logic gate
---

You can rotate logic gates, allowing you to change the position of their inputs and outputs. By default, when a gate is created, it faces the direction the player is looking. After entering the `/logicgates rotate` command, you will receive a magical wand â€“ **"Rotation Wand"**, used for rotating gates.

If the player already has the wand, the plugin does not add another one to their inventory but instead notifies them that they already possess it.

The magical wand is an `minecraft:stick` item named **"Rotation Wand"** (in green) with the description: **"Right-click a logic gate to rotate it."**. It also has a unique identifier `customModelData = 1450`, which distinguishes it from regular sticks.

When the wand is used on a gate block, the gate's data is retrieved, and it is rotated clockwise. After the rotation, the player receives a message indicating the new direction of the gate. All changes are saved to the `gates.json` file.
