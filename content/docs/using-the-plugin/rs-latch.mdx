title: RS Latch
---

The plugin implements the RS latch (RS flip-flop) element, which is used in logic circuits to store a single bit of information (0 or 1). It is a type of memory circuit based on RS logic (Reset-Set).

The RS Latch consists of two inputs:

- (R) Blue – the reset input.
- (S) Red – the set input.

The RS Latch can also be built using two logic gates, typically **NAND** or **NOR**, which create a feedback loop that allows for state storage.

After restarting or reloading the server, the state of all RS Latch gates is saved and loaded from the `gates.json` file.
