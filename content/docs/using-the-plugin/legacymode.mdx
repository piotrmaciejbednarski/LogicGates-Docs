title: Legacy Mode
description: If you are having trouble updating your logic gate output, use Legacy Mode.
---

When `legacyMode` is enabled, the plugin updates the redstone power state of blocks using the legacy method. This method involves directly setting the outputBlock to either `REDSTONE_BLOCK` or `REDSTONE_ORE` based on the desired output state. This approach is simpler and may be more compatible with older versions of game.

When `legacyMode` is disabled, the plugin uses the modern method for updating the redstone power state of blocks. This method involves using the GateUtils.setRedstonePower function, which provides more advanced and nuanced control over the redstone power state.

## Enabling legacyMode
To enable legacyMode, set the value to true:

```yaml
# When enabled (set to true), the plugin will use the legacy method for updating
# redstone power. Instead of using the method setRedstonePower, it will update
# the block by setting the outputBlock to REDSTONE_BLOCK or REDSTONE_ORE based on the output state.
# This is useful for maintaining compatibility with older versions of the plugin or game.
legacyMode: true
```
