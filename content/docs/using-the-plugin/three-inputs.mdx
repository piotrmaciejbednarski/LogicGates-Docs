title: Three-input logic gates
---

By default, logic gates in the plugin have two inputs, except for NOT and TIMER gates.

You can extend a logic gate's inputs to three using the `/logicgates toggleinput` command. After entering the command, click on the gate you want to modify. If you want to switch a three-input gate back to a two-input gate, enter the command again and follow the same steps.

If you need a logic gate with more than three inputs, you can chain multiple gates in series. This allows you to create logic gates with even dozens of inputs. An example of such a setup is shown below â€” a four-input AND gate.
