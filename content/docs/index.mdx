title: âœ‹ Introduction
description: LogicGates is a plugin for Spigot servers that allows you to create advanced logic circuits in an incredibly simple way. With this plugin, you can build any logic gate in the size of a single block, which makes creating complex mechanisms much easier and faster.

## Key Features

- **Extensive Gate Selection:** Build one of the 7 basic logic gates (NOT, OR, AND, XOR, NOR, NAND, XNOR) and additional gates such as implication, TIMER (oscillator), or RS-Latch (memory gate).
- **Intuitive Interface:** Choose gates using a graphical interface (GUI).
- **High Performance:** The plugin runs efficiently thanks to a system of synchronization with server ticks, task queuing, batch processing, and many optimization techniques.
- **Lightweight and Efficient**: The plugin's compact size (under **60kB**) contributes to its efficient performance and low resource usage.
- **Ready to Use:** After installation, the plugin is immediately ready to use, no configuration is required.
- **Easy Internationalization:** Add your own plugin translations by editing the `messages.yml` file.
- **JSON Saving:** Gates are saved in JSON format, which makes them easy to process by external software.
- **Unlimited Possibilities:** Develop and create even more advanced Redstone mechanisms.
- **WorldEdit Integration:** The plugin integrates with the WorldEdit API, allowing you to copy and paste gates.
