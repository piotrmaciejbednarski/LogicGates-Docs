title: NOR gate
---

The NOR gate is the inverse of the OR gate. It outputs true (1) only when both inputs are false (0). In all other cases, the output is false (0). It stands for "NOT OR" and is often used in logical circuits as a universal gate, meaning any logic function can be built using only NOR gates.
