title: XNOR gate
---

The XNOR (exclusive NOR) gate is the inverse of the XOR gate. It outputs true (1) if both inputs are the same, either both true or both false. If the inputs differ, the output is false (0). It stands for "NOT XOR" and is used in situations where equality is required for the result to be true.
