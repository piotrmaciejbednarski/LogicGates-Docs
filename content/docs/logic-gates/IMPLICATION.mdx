title: Implication gate
---

The implication gate, often represented as A -> B, is a logical operation where the output is false (0) only when the first input (A) is true (1) and the second input (B) is false (0). In all other cases, the output is true (1). It can be interpreted as "if A then B," meaning that if the first condition (A) holds true, the second condition (B) must also hold true for the implication to be true.

- Truth table for implication:
  - **True → True** = True
  - **True → False** = False
  - **False → True** = True
  - **False → False** = True

Implication is commonly used in logic to express conditional statements and is often seen in formal logic and computer science.
