title: NAND gate
---

The NAND gate is the inverse of the AND gate. It outputs false (0) only when both of its inputs are true (1). In all other cases, the output is true (1). It stands for "NOT AND" and is commonly used in digital circuits due to its versatility, as any other logic gate can be implemented with NAND gates alone.
